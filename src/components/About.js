        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        I have a passion for Coding and Consider myself to be a result-oriented and a self-driven Full stack Python developer with B.Tech in computer science. As a fresher, my inclination was towards both front end and back end where I excel in Python, JavaScript, Django, React and Node, and more. Over the course of my studies I have gained a thorough knowledge of software architecture, data structures and algorithms, and contemporary software development processes. I am eager to leverage technology, bring out the solutions to the hardest problems and work on the rich and user friendly web applications which are not only effective but also scalable. I am open to acquiring new knowledge and improving myself in active growth areas of the industry known for being on the cutting-edge-think cloud, AI, data. Looking to make a difference after all the education Iâ€™ve received and more so no where looking for any projects that am free of charge as I am already aware of all technologies in reach and creating solutions that are simply ordinary.
